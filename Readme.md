**Scenario: Implementation of a Three-Tier Application Pipeline on ECS**

### Objective:
To establish a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a three-tier application using Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) with Docker containers.

### Architecture Overview:
1. **Frontend Tier:**
   - Web application hosted on ECS Fargate.
   - Utilizes NGINX as a reverse proxy.
   - Dockerized frontend code deployed as containers.

2. **Backend Tier:**
   - Application logic powered by a Node.js server.
   - Containerized backend code deployed on ECS Fargate.

3. **Database Tier:**
   - Relational database managed by Amazon RDS.
   - Stores application data.

### Pipeline Components:
1. **Source:**
   - GitHub repository containing the three-tier application code.

2. **Build:**
   - AWS CodeBuild configured to build Docker images for the frontend and backend.
   - Docker images tagged and pushed to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

3. **Deploy:**
   - AWS CodePipeline orchestrating deployment steps.
   - ECS service definitions updated to use the latest Docker images.

### Step-by-Step Implementation:

#### 1. Setup ECS Cluster:
   - Create an ECS cluster to host frontend and backend services.
   - Define ECS task definitions specifying Docker containers for NGINX, Node.js server, and associated configurations.

#### 2. Configure RDS:
   - Provision an Amazon RDS instance for the backend tier.
   - Configure database schema, user credentials, and connection details.

#### 3. Set Up ECR Repositories:
   - Create separate ECR repositories for frontend and backend Docker images.

#### 4. Implement CI/CD Pipeline:
   - Configure AWS CodeBuild projects for frontend and backend.
   - Define build specifications to build Docker images and push them to corresponding ECR repositories.
   - Create an AWS CodePipeline to automate the flow from source to deployment.

#### 5. Define ECS Services:
   - Create ECS services for the frontend and backend using the defined task definitions.
   - Ensure ECS services can access the ECR repositories for image retrieval.

#### 6. Configure Load Balancer:
   - Set up an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute incoming traffic to ECS services.

### Testing and Monitoring:
1. **Testing:**
   - Conduct thorough testing of the three-tier application in the ECS environment.
   - Perform unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing.

2. **Monitoring:**
   - Implement CloudWatch alarms for ECS service health.
   - Configure logging for ECS containers and RDS to capture relevant application logs.
